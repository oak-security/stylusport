# Research Prompt: Solana Program Crate Pattern Analysis

You are analyzing a corpus of concatenated, structured reports covering 39 Solana program repositories comprising 154 distinct program crates. Each report includes:

• File tree structure
• Cargo.toml dependencies
• Package descriptions
• Feature highlights
• Implementation details

The total token count is under 100K and fits within a single processing context.

## Objectives

### 1. Structural Pattern Discovery

• Identify common directory layouts (src/, instructions/, tests/, etc.)
• Extract naming conventions for files and modules (e.g. entrypoint.rs, lib.rs, mod.rs, processor/)
• Infer design patterns (e.g. separation of concerns, instruction routing modules, PDA utils)

### 2. Feature and Dependency Pattern Mining

• Determine commonly used crates and their purpose (e.g. borsh, spl-token, solana-program, thiserror, etc.)
• Identify standard features implemented across crates:
  • Token swap execution
  • Governance / voting
  • Multisig
  • Logging, error handling
  • gRPC/RPC integrations
  • Test harnesses (e.g. LiteSVM, solana-program-test)

### 3. Development Practices and Architecture

• Detect standard coding practices across crates:
  • Error handling approaches (e.g. thiserror, anyhow)
  • Use of PDAs and CPIs
  • Common testing frameworks and test directory structures
  • Configuration management (e.g. env support, default-env)

### 4. Outlier and Anomaly Detection

• Identify crates that deviate from the norm in structure, dependencies, or features:
  • Crates missing tests
  • Minimalist designs (e.g. only lib.rs)
  • Unusual dependency graphs (e.g. metaplex-token-metadata, yellowstone-grpc-proto)
  • Unique patterns (e.g. security reporting, mock swap programs, NFT minting logic)

### 5. Source Attribution

• For each detected pattern or outlier, annotate its origin:
  • Which repo and crate it came from
  • Possible rationale (e.g. benchmarking tool vs. production DEX vs. governance framework)

**ENSURE THAT ALL THE REPORTS ARE ANALYSED - THE DATA PROVIDED IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EXTERNAL SOURCES.**

**ONLY USE EXTERNAL SOURCES TO AUGMENT THE REPORT BASED ON THE PROVIDED DATA.**

**THERE IS NO REPORT LENGTH LIMIT - THOROUGHNESS IS REQUIRED!**
