```

### Package Summary
The `sequence_enforcer` is a Solana program designed to manage and validate sequence numbers for a specific authority. It provides a mechanism to track and enforce ordered operations by ensuring sequence numbers only increase, preventing replay attacks and maintaining transaction sequencing.

### Key Features
- Program Derived Address (PDA) based sequence tracking
- Authority-controlled sequence number management
- Prevents sequence number from decreasing
- Supports initialization, reset, and sequence validation
- Secure signature-based access control

### Notable Implementation Details
- Uses Anchor framework for program development
- Implements strict sequence number validation
- Supports flexible sequence number reset
- Designed for scenarios requiring ordered, non-repeatable operations

### Use Cases
- Transaction ordering in complex multi-step processes
- Preventing replay attacks
- Implementing rate limiting or operation sequencing
- Ensuring deterministic execution order in distributed systems

The program provides a robust, blockchain-native solution for managing sequential operations with cryptographic integrity.
