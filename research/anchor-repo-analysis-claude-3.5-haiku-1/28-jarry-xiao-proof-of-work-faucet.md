- solana-sdk: Solana blockchain SDK
- solana-client: Solana network interaction
- borsh: Binary object representation serializer for hashing
- tokio: Asynchronous runtime
- rand: Random number generation
- itertools: Iterator utility functions
- serde: Serialization and deserialization
- reqwest: HTTP client for network requests
- proof-of-work-faucet: Local program interface
- anchor-lang: Anchor framework for Solana program development
- bs58: Base58 encoding/decoding
```

## Package Summary
A Solana devnet CLI tool that allows developers to mine and claim SOL tokens by solving computational proof-of-work challenges. Users can create faucets, list available faucets, and generate keypairs that meet specific difficulty criteria to claim rewards.

## Notable Features
1. Proof-of-Work based token distribution
2. Configurable mining difficulty
3. Multi-network support (devnet, mainnet, localnet)
4. Automatic faucet discovery
5. Keypair generation with specific base58 prefix requirements

## Implementation Highlights
- Uses Anchor framework for program interaction
- Leverages Solana SDK for blockchain operations
- Implements asynchronous mining with Tokio
- Supports flexible difficulty and reward mechanisms
- Provides a developer-friendly way to obtain test SOL tokens

The CLI serves as a practical utility for Solana developers, simplifying the process of obtaining test tokens through a gamified, computational challenge approach.

└── src/
    └── lib.rs                  # Main Solana program implementation for PoW Faucet
```

### Dependencies
```toml

bs58: "0.5.0"                   # Base58 encoding/decoding utility
```

### Package Summary
A Solana program implementing a Proof-of-Work (PoW) token faucet that allows users to receive SOL tokens by solving computational challenges. Users must generate a public key with a specified number of leading 'A' characters to prove computational effort.

### Notable Features
- Cryptographic challenge-response mechanism
- Configurable difficulty levels
- Secure PDA-based token distribution
- Prevents easy token farming through computational requirements
- Uses base58 encoding for difficulty verification

### Implementation Highlights
- Generates public keys with specific leading character constraints
- Uses Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for secure token management
- Implements custom difficulty verification logic
- Provides a controlled, rate-limited token distribution mechanism

### Security Considerations
- Computational challenge prevents trivial token acquisition
- PDA-based design ensures controlled token distribution
- Difficulty can be dynamically configured

The package represents an innovative approach to token distribution that requires genuine computational effort, making it more equitable and resistant to automated token farming.
