## Package Summary
A flexible, multi-strategy vault management protocol on Solana that enables:
- Cross-platform token investment strategies
- Liquidity management across different DeFi protocols
- Configurable performance fee mechanism
- Gradual profit release (locked profit tracking)

## Notable Features
1. Multi-Protocol Strategy Support
   - Supports strategies from Solend, Mango, Apricot, Cypher, etc.
   - Dynamically manages investments across different platforms

2. Advanced Profit Management
   - Implements Yearn-inspired locked profit mechanism
   - Gradual profit release over 6 hours
   - 5% configurable performance fee

3. Robust PDA (Program Derived Address) Management
   - Deterministic address generation for vaults, strategies, and accounts
   - Consistent cross-platform address derivation
   - Supports multiple network environments (mainnet, devnet, staging)

4. Flexible Vault Configuration
   - Supports different vault types (standard, idle)
   - Enables deposit, withdrawal, and strategy rebalancing
   - Comprehensive error handling and event logging

## Key Design Patterns
- Modular strategy implementation
- Comprehensive account validation
- Predictable address generation
- Controlled profit distribution
- Cross-platform interoperability

The package represents a sophisticated DeFi vault SDK that provides a flexible framework for managing token investments across multiple Solana-based protocols.

- bincode                       # Binary serialization/deserialization
```

### Package Summary
The rust-client is a Solana blockchain client application for interacting with the Mercurial Vault program. It provides a command-line interface for managing token vaults, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and query vault states across different Solana network clusters.

### Notable Features
1. Flexible CLI with multiple subcommands for vault interactions
2. Support for different Solana network clusters (Devnet, Mainnet, etc.)
3. Custom wallet and keypair configuration
4. Utility functions for token account management
5. Transaction simulation and event log parsing
6. Programmatic token mint and vault operations

### Key Implementation Details
- Uses Anchor framework for Solana program development
- Supports Associated Token Account (ATA) management
- Provides generic utility functions for transaction simulation
- Implements event log parsing for blockchain interactions
- Modular design with separate modules for different functionalities

The package serves as a robust client-side implementation for interacting with a token vault protocol, offering both CLI and programmatic interfaces for token management.
