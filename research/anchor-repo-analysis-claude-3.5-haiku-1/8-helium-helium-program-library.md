   - Requires minimum oracle participation for price updates

3. Flexible Oracle Management
   - Dynamic oracle list configuration
   - Authority-based access control
   - Optional price and timestamp tracking

4. Security Considerations
   - Custom error handling
   - Authority validation for price submissions
   - Prevents unauthorized oracle modifications

### Implementation Highlights
- Uses Anchor framework for Solana program development
- Implements a decentralized price aggregation mechanism
- Supports partial updates to oracle configuration
- Provides clear, versioned instruction set for oracle management

The price oracle is designed to be a flexible, secure system for tracking prices from multiple sources, with built-in mechanisms for validation, updates, and governance.
