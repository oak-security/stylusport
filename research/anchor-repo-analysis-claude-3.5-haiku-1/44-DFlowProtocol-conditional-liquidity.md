### Package Summary
The Segmenter Registry is a Solana program designed to manage a controlled, administrative registry of unique public keys (segmenters). It provides a secure mechanism for adding, removing, and tracking a limited set of registered entities with strict access controls.

### Key Features
1. Administrative Access Control
- Single admin can manage the registry
- Ability to change admin
- Prevents unauthorized modifications

2. Registry Management
- Fixed-size registry (supports up to 64 entries)
- Prevents duplicate registrations
- Efficient key storage and lookup using sorted array
- Zero-copy account for performance optimization

3. Instruction Set
- Initialize program configuration
- Create registry
- Add segmenter
- Remove segmenter
- Change admin

### Notable Implementation Details
- Uses Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for deterministic account generation
- Implements custom error handling
- Leverages Anchor framework for account validation
- Efficient binary search for key registration checks
- Immutable size constraint on registry

### Security Considerations
- Admin-only modifications
- Duplicate entry prevention
- Registry capacity limit
- Explicit account validation

The program provides a robust, controlled mechanism for managing a curated list of registered entities with minimal overhead and maximum security.
