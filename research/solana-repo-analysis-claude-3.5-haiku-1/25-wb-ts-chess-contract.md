## Dependencies
```toml
solana-program@1.9.4   # Core Solana blockchain program development toolkit
thiserror@1.0.24      # Convenient error handling and derivation
arrayref@0.3.6        # Efficient low-level byte array manipulation
```

## Package Summary
A Solana-based chess escrow program that facilitates secure, two-party transactions with stake management. The program allows participants to create escrow accounts, deposit funds, and withdraw based on game outcomes, with built-in signature verification and fee handling.

## Notable Features
1. PDA (Program Derived Address) for secure account management
2. Custom error handling with detailed error variants
3. Flexible instruction processing (init and withdraw)
4. Rent-exempt account creation
5. Secure fund transfer mechanisms
6. Byte-level serialization and deserialization

## Implementation Highlights
- Uses Solana's program primitives for cross-program invocation
- Implements trait-based serialization (Pack, Sealed)
- Supports two-party escrow with admin-controlled withdrawals
- Efficient byte manipulation for account state management
- Modular design separating concerns across different modules

The program provides a robust framework for managing chess-related financial transactions on the Solana blockchain, ensuring security and transparency through carefully designed account and instruction handling.
