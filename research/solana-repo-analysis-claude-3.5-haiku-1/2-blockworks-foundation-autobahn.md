solana-program@1.17           # Core Solana blockchain programming library
spl-token@4.0.0               # Solana Program Library for token operations
```

## Package Summary
A lightweight Solana program that provides a simplified mock token swap mechanism, enabling direct token transfers between specified token accounts with minimal complexity.

## Key Features
- Simplified token transfer between accounts
- Uses SPL Token program for transfers
- Supports simultaneous transfers of two token amounts
- Designed for testing or as a basic swap template
- Requires 7 specific accounts for execution

## Implementation Highlights
- Uses `invoke_signed` for cross-program invocations
- No price calculation or slippage logic
- Direct, deterministic token transfers
- Minimal error handling
- Serves as a potential prototype for more complex swap mechanisms

## Potential Use Cases
- Unit testing token transfer scenarios
- Mocking swap behaviors in development
- Educational example of token program interactions
- Baseline for building more advanced decentralized exchange logic

## Security Considerations
- Lacks comprehensive input validation
- No explicit access control mechanisms
- Requires careful account management during invocation

Recommendation: Treat this as a development/testing utility, not a production-ready swap implementation.
