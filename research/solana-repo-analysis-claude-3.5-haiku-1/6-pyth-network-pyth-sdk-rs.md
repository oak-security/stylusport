pyth-sdk-solana = "0.10.0"      # Pyth Network SDK for Solana
solana-program = ">= 1.10"      # Core Solana program development library
bytemuck = "1.7.2"              # Utility for type casting and memory manipulation
borsh = "0.10.3"                # Serialization library for Rust
borsh-derive = "0.10.3"         # Derive macros for Borsh serialization
```

### Package Summary
This is a test contract for the Pyth Network Solana SDK, designed to provide a comprehensive test suite for mathematical operations on price data. The package implements a Solana program that can perform various mathematical transformations on Pyth price types, including division, multiplication, normalization, and exponent scaling.

### Notable Features
1. Modular program structure with clear separation of concerns
2. Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases in price calculations
3. Support for complex mathematical operations on price data
4. Flexible instruction set for price manipulation
5. Uses Borsh for efficient serialization
6. Designed for local testing and SDK validation

### Key Implementation Details
- Supports mathematical operations like:
  - Division
  - Multiplication
  - Addition
  - Price normalization
  - Exponent scaling
- Handles extreme input values (max/min prices)
- Provides a robust testing framework for Pyth price calculations
- Uses Solana program testing utilities for instruction validation

The package serves as both a test suite and a reference implementation for mathematical operations in the Pyth Network's Solana price oracle ecosystem.

## Package Summary
A Solana program that implements a loan-to-value (L2V) verification system using Pyth price oracles. The program allows administrators to configure price feed accounts and perform loan risk assessments by comparing loan and collateral values using decentralized price data.

## Key Features
1. Pyth Price Oracle Integration
   - Uses real-time price feeds for accurate asset valuation
   - Supports multiple token types
   - Handles different price exponents

2. Loan Risk Assessment
   - Calculates loan-to-value ratio
   - Checks collateral sufficiency
   - Considers price confidence intervals

3. Administrative Configuration
   - Allows program initialization with price feed accounts
   - Restricted initialization to program owner
   - Stores configuration in on-chain state

## Notable Implementation Details
- Uses Borsh serialization for compact data storage
- Modular program structure with separate modules
- Secure price feed validation
- Handles potential price feed inconsistencies
- Provides a reusable pattern for decentralized lending risk assessment

## Security Considerations
- Price feed staleness checks
- Confidence interval validation
- Administrative access controls
- Precise value normalization

The program demonstrates an advanced use of Solana's program model and Pyth's decentralized price oracle infrastructure for financial risk assessment.
