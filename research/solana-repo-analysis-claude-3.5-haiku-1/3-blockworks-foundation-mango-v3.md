## Dependencies
```toml
syn: "1.0.74"             # Syntax parsing library for procedural macros
solana-program: ">=1.9.0" # Solana blockchain program development support
bytemuck: "^1.7.2"        # Safe zero-initialization and byte-level type conversions
quote: "^1.0.9"           # Token stream generation for procedural macros
safe-transmute: "^0.11.1" # Safe type transmutation utilities
mango-common: {path="../common"} # Internal shared utilities
```

## Package Summary
Mango Macro is a procedural macro library designed to provide safe, low-level memory manipulation traits for Rust structs, specifically tailored for systems programming and memory-efficient data structures in the Mango V3 project.

## Notable Features
- Provides three key procedural macros:
  1. `Loadable`: Implements loading traits for structs
  2. `Pod`: Enables safe zero-initialization and byte-level representations
  3. `TriviallyTransmutable`: Allows safe byte-level type transmutation

- Focuses on compile-time type safety and memory efficiency
- Designed to work seamlessly with Solana's low-level programming requirements
- Supports safe memory operations without runtime overhead

## Implementation Highlights
- Uses `bytemuck` for zero-initialization and byte-level type conversions
- Leverages `safe-transmute` for secure type transmutation
- Procedural macros generate trait implementations at compile-time
- Strict type checking to prevent misuse with inappropriate data types

## Use Cases
- Serialization of complex structs
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Low-level system programming
- Solana program development with precise memory control

The package serves as a critical utility for the Mango V3 project, providing safe, performant memory manipulation tools.

## research/solana-repos/3-blockworks-foundation-mango-v3/common/Cargo.toml

Here's a comprehensive report on the Solana program package:

## File Tree Diagram
```
common/
│
├── Cargo.toml                 # Package configuration and dependencies
└── src/
    └── lib.rs                 # Defines Loadable trait for safe account data loading
```

## Dependency List
```toml
[dependencies]
solana-program = ">=1.9.0"     # Core Solana program development library
bytemuck = "^1.7.2"            # Zero-cost type conversions and byte-level transformations
```

## Package Summary
The `common` package provides a utility trait `Loadable` that simplifies and standardizes safe data loading from Solana program accounts. It offers a generic, type-safe mechanism for converting raw account bytes into structured data with minimal overhead.

## Notable Features
1. Uses `bytemuck` for zero-cost byte conversions
2. Provides safe, generic methods for immutable and mutable account data loading
3. Requires implementing types to be `Pod` (Plain Old Data)
4. Abstracts away complex byte slice borrowing and conversion logic

## Implementation Details
- Trait methods:
  - `load()`: Immutably load account data
  - `load_mut()`: Mutably load account data
  - `load_from_bytes()`: Load data from raw byte slices

The package serves as a foundational utility for Solana program developers, offering a consistent and safe approach to account data manipulation.
