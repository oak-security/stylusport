├── Cargo.toml         # Package configuration and dependencies
├── src/
│   └── lib.rs         # Main program logic for on-chain NFT metadata management
└── tests/
    └── integration.rs # BPF integration test framework
```

### Dependency List
```toml
solana-program = "1.6.7"  # Core Solana program development library
```

### Package Summary
This is an on-chain NFT metadata management program that allows flexible, incremental creation and updates of NFT metadata directly on the Solana blockchain. The program provides a unique approach to storing and managing NFT metadata through program-derived addresses (PDAs) with granular update capabilities.

### Notable Features
1. Metadata Account Types
   - Author account
   - Title account
   - URI account
   - Generic data account

2. Flexible Metadata Management
   - Incremental data updates
   - Chunk-based data setting
   - Permanent metadata sealing mechanism

3. Access Control
   - Requires original creator/funder signature
   - Implements basic permission checks

4. PDA-based Design
   - Uses program-derived addresses for deterministic account generation
   - Enables secure, programmatic account management

### Implementation Highlights
- Supports multiple metadata update instructions
- Provides a "seal" mechanism to lock metadata
- Designed for granular, controlled metadata management
- Enables on-chain metadata storage with update flexibility

### Potential Use Cases
- NFT metadata creation and management
- Incremental content updates for digital assets
- Controlled metadata evolution with final locking capability

The program represents a flexible, programmatic approach to managing NFT metadata directly on the Solana blockchain.
