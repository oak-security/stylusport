}
```

## Package Summary
A minimal Solana program designed to facilitate direct SOL token transfers between accounts using cross-program invocation (CPI) through the System Program. The program provides a programmatic way to transfer SOL tokens by parsing transfer amount from instruction data.

## Notable Features
- Simple, single-purpose SOL transfer mechanism
- Uses Solana's System Program for token transfers
- Supports arbitrary transfer amounts
- Implements cross-program invocation (CPI)
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Designed for testing and demonstration purposes

## Implementation Highlights
- Parses transfer amount from first 8 bytes of instruction data
- Requires three accounts: payer, recipient, system program
- Leverages `system_instruction::transfer()` for secure token movement
- Demonstrates basic Solana program structure and CPI usage

## Security Considerations
- No additional validation beyond basic account requirements
- Relies on System Program for transfer logic
- Suitable for educational/testing scenarios, not recommended for production without additional checks

- Follows standard Solana program signature
- No state modification or complex logic
- Serves as a pedagogical example of Solana program structure

## Implementation Highlights
- Single function `process_instruction` as program entrypoint
- Always returns successful execution (`Ok(())`)
- Accepts standard Solana program parameters but doesn't utilize them
- Demonstrates minimal boilerplate for Solana program development

## Purpose
Primarily used as:
- Educational example
- Starting template for new Solana program developers
- Minimal demonstration of Solana program structure

Complexity: ★☆☆☆☆ (Very Low)
Utility: ★★☆☆☆ (Basic/Educational)
