## Package Summary
The package is a Solana NFT (Non-Fungible Token) minting program called "Glitch Punks" that allows users to mint a limited series of 1000 unique NFTs. The program charges a fixed fee of 100,000,000 lamports per mint and generates NFT metadata with unique Arweave URLs.

## Notable Features
1. Limited edition NFT series (max 1000 tokens)
2. Fixed minting fee
3. Unique Arweave-based metadata generation
4. Comprehensive error handling
5. Modular program structure following Solana best practices
6. Integration testing support

## Implementation Highlights
- Uses Solana SPL Token and Metadata programs
- Implements custom state tracking
- Provides robust instruction parsing
- Includes comprehensive error management
- Supports programmatic NFT minting with predefined constraints

The program represents a well-structured, production-ready Solana NFT minting solution with clear separation of concerns and robust implementation details.
