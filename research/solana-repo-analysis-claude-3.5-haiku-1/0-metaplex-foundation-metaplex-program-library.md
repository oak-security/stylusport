## Package Summary
The NFT Packs program is a sophisticated Solana blockchain program designed to manage collectible NFT pack distributions. It enables creators to:
- Create pack sets with configurable distribution rules
- Add NFT cards to packs with weighted randomization
- Manage pack lifecycle (initialization, activation, deactivation)
- Implement controlled NFT card redemption mechanisms

## Notable Features
1. Weighted Randomization: Supports different card distribution types (Max Supply, Fixed, Unlimited)
2. Flexible Pack Management: Comprehensive state transitions and lifecycle management
3. Secure Redemption: Controlled card claiming with randomness and supply tracking
4. Metaplex Integration: Leverages Metaplex NFT metadata and token standards
5. Safe Mathematical Operations: Custom safe math implementations to prevent overflows
6. Extensive Error Handling: Detailed custom error types for precise failure reporting

The program provides a robust framework for creating gamified, randomized NFT distribution experiences on the Solana blockchain.
