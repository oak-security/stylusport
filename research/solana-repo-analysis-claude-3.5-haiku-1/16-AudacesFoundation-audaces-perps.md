```

## Package Summary
The `utils_mock_oracle` is a lightweight Solana program designed to simulate a simple price oracle for testing and development purposes. Its primary function is to provide a minimal implementation for updating and storing a price value in a Solana account.

## Notable Features
- Single instruction type: `ChangePrice`
- Direct byte-level price update in account data
- Minimal implementation focusing on core Solana program structure
- Designed for testing and mock oracle scenarios
- Follows standard Solana program modular architecture

## Implementation Highlights
- Uses Borsh for instruction data serialization
- Implements a basic instruction processing pattern
- Writes price as a 64-bit little-endian byte array
- Provides a simple mechanism for price manipulation in a controlled environment

## Use Cases
- Blockchain development testing
- Simulating oracle price updates
- Educational example of Solana program structure
- Prototype for more complex oracle implementations

The package serves as a lightweight, educational tool for understanding Solana program development and oracle-like functionality.
