## Package Summary
SimpleDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) Solana program that enables users to create, cancel, and match token trading offers with built-in fee calculations and robust account validation.

## Notable Features
1. Custom packed binary serialization
2. Comprehensive account validation checks
3. Flexible offer creation and matching
4. Programmatic fee calculation
5. Secure PDA (Program Derived Address) management
6. Detailed error handling with custom error types
7. Modular program architecture
8. Support for partial offer matching
9. Integrated token holding account management

## Key Implementation Details
- Uses Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs) for deterministic account generation
- Implements custom serialization for compact instruction encoding
- Provides type-safe numerical calculations with precise rounding
- Supports cross-program invocations (CPIs) for token transfers
- Includes comprehensive test suite with property-based testing

The program represents a sophisticated, security-focused implementation of a decentralized token exchange on the Solana blockchain.
