## Dependencies
```json
{
  "bytemuck": "1.18.0",     # Safe byte-level type conversions
  "solana-program": "2.0.10", # Core Solana blockchain programming library

## Package Summary
A native Solana escrow program that enables secure, trustless token exchanges between two parties. The program allows users to:
1. Create token exchange offers (Make)
2. Accept existing offers (Take)
3. Refund/cancel offers (Refund)

## Notable Features
- Uses Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs) for secure account management
- Supports cross-program invocations (CPIs) for token transfers
- Implements type-safe instruction parsing
- Provides comprehensive error handling
- Includes integration tests for core functionality
- Compatible with both SPL Token and Token-2022 programs

## Implementation Highlights
- Modular design with separate modules for different transaction stages
- Robust account validation
- Atomic token swaps with built-in safety mechanisms
- Efficient use of Solana's runtime and account model
- Supports flexible token exchange scenarios

The program represents a sophisticated, production-ready token escrow implementation on the Solana blockchain.
